# GroundsCommerce

This project was created under strict time constrains for a university distinction project, this mean the code is unfortunately uncommented (I hope to add commenting when I have time). 

GroundsCommerce is a enterprise commerce application using Java EE, developed in NetBeans. This project should be used as a reference when creating a fully featured commerce platform, using Java EE. The system is comprised of multiple different java beans and the system sits in a 4 tier architecture structure.
